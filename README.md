Sylvia+ mobile app

This repository is structured/grouped by features. Pease follow this structure so we can keep
the repository organized. Below is a more detailed explanation of what each folder contains:

app folder- Includes data folder and feature folders (i.e. home, log-in, shopping-cart, product-details, ...);
            Files about a specific feature should be placed in the respective feature folder. For example,
            the log-in feature folder should contain the file for account handling, log-in page style,
            components, or other such files.
            
assets folder - Contains images and fonts

styles folder - Contains styling that is used app-wide. This provides a single location for changing colors, themes,
                styles used by multiple pages.

Enjoy!
